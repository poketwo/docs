**Currencies**\



Pokétwo has 2 different currencies: Pokécoins (PC) and shards. You can check your balance using the command _p!bal_. By default, it will also appear on the top of _Shop_. You can toggle this with the command _p!togglebal_.

PC is the main currency, used for the majority of services including _Market, Auctions,_ and most of the _Shop._ As it is tradable, it can also be used in _Trading_.&#x20;

Shards are the premium currency which can be bought for 200 PC each, and are used to buy items such as redeems in page 7 of _The Shop._ It is non-tradable and can be bought with real currency at poketwo.net/store`.`\


## **Ways to Earn Money**

* Catching Pokémon (you earn 35 PC for the first catch, 350 for the 10th catch, 3500 for the 100th catch, etc).
* Releasing Pokémon (2 PC each)
* Completing quests. (Active quests can be viewed using p!quests).&#x20;
* Selling Pokémon you have caught using the #want-to-sell in the official server, or the _Market_.(Collectors are often willing to buy bulk amounts of specific Pokémon).
* Auctioning.
* _Auction/Market_ flipping (this method is recommended for seasoned players who know their prices). \


## **Items**

Items can be bought in the _Shop,_ by using the command: _p!buy \<item name>._ To flip through pages, use the command: _p!shop \<page number>_ .\
