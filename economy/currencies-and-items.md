**Currencies**\
\
Pokétwo has 2 different currencies: pc (pokécoins) and shards, with pc being the main currency, used for the majority of services including _The Market, Auctions,_ and all pages of _The Shop_ except page 7.\
Shards are the other Pokétwo currency which can be bought for 200 pc each, and are used to buy items in page 7 of _The Shop._\
__\
__**Money Making Methods**

Some more popular and common ways to earn pc include:\
\-Catching pokémon (earns 35 pc the first time you catch a pokémon, 350 pc for the 10th catch, 3500pc for the 100th catch, etc).\
\-Completing quests. (Active quests can be viewed using p!quests). \
\-Selling pokémon you have caught using #want-to-sell, or _The Market_.(Often collectors are willing to buy bulk amounts of specific pokémon).\
\-Auctioning (note: this method can be risky).\
\-_Auction/Market_ flipping (this method is also risky, and is recommended for experienced players). An effective flipping method is bidding on something from _Auctions_ which is going for a cheap price, less then its base market value, and then selling it on the market for more if you win the auction.\
\
**Items**\
****Items can be bought in _The Shop,_ by using the command: p!buy \<item name> , and to scroll through each page, use the command: p!shop \<page number> .\
The items you can buy in the shop are as follows:\
\-Page 1: Xp boosters and rare candies\
\-Page 2: Evolution stones (instant evolution for compatible pokémon)\
\-Page 3: Form changing items \
\-Page 4: The everstone (prevents a pokemon from evolving while holding it), The xp blocker (prevents a pokemon from gaining any xp while holding it), and various evolution items.\
\-Page 5: Mints (changes the nature of a pokémon (which slightly changes its stats)).\
\-Page 6: Mega evolutions. If you intend to Mega evolve a pokemon, use the command: p!buy mega evolution (this can also be used for Kyogre and Groudon's primal evolutions). If you want to mega evolve a Charizard or Mewtwo, use p!buy  x mega evolution , or p!buy y mega evolution respectively.\
\-Page 7: All items that can be bought with shards.
