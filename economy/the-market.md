Welcome to The Market!\


The Market is a pretty self-explanatory system in Pokétwo where any player can buy or sell Pokémon. The Market is a vast system with over 10 million listings of different Pokémon to choose from! What makes The Market special is that anyone can buy, sell, or even just view Pokémon easily without any direct contact with a buyer or seller. This makes sales quick, easy, and always available to anyone. Let's get into some of the Market basics!\
\
\
**Market Searching -** \
If you are looking to search The Market for Pokémon, you can use **p!m s** to show the most recent page of listed Pokémon (1 page = 20 Listings). If you want to search for specific Pokémon on the market, you can search with filters including:\
**--mine** (Shows the listings you own)\
**--o price** (Shows the Pokémon you've searched for ordered by cheapest to most expensive) (You can also use **--o price-** to show the listings of that Pokémon ordered from most expensive to least expensive)\
**--o id** (Shows the Pokémon you've searched for ordered by the first listings of that Pokémon) (You can also use **--o id-** to show the most recent listings of that Pokémon)\
\
\* **These commands above are market-specific, but all commands that are used in Filters also apply to The Market** ([search-filters.md](../intermediate-topics/search-filters.md "mention"))\
\* When filtering The Market you can use multiple filters to specify listings even further (For Example: **p!m s --name Pikachu** shows all Pikachus, but you can filter this further by doing **p!M s --name Pikachu --shiny** filters the market even further to show only shiny Pikachus)\
\
\
**Market "Infoing" -** \
****When you see a Pokémon you might be interested in, and want to see its stats, you can use **p!m info \<listing number>** and the pokemon's info will show up, displaying stats, experience, and item as if it were your own.\
\
(For reference a listing's ID is the number to the left of the small Pokémon's icon. For example, on this listing:![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (23).png>)The ID is 16214200)\
\
\
**Market Buying -** \
When you have found a Pokémon that you want to purchase (We recommend infoing it first to make sure it's what you want) you can use **p!m b \<listing ID>** to purchase that Pokémon, and a message will come up asking you to confirm that you want to purchase that Pokémon. You can click **Confirm** to purchase that Pokémon, or click **Cancel** to decline the purchase.\
\
\
**Market Selling -** \
One method players use to make money is selling their Pokémon on The Market. You can add one of your Pokémonon to The Market by using **p!m add \<Pokémon number> \<price>** and a confirmation message will show up asking you if you want to add that Pokémon for that price. You can click **Confirm** to add that Pokémon to The Market, or click **Cancel** to not add that Pokémon. \
\
\*Note: A Pokémon you listed might not always sell immediately, so your best chance of selling your Pokémon is searching for Pokémon with similar stats and adding yours for a slightly cheaper price, and eventually, someone will buy.\
\
(For reference: A Pokémon's number is **NOT** the same thing as a market ID. When you show your Pokémon with **p!pokemon** or **p!p** for short, a Pokémon's number is the left-most number next to the Pokémon's icon. For Example:\
![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (12).png>)\
This Pokémon's number is 1731, so by using **p!m add 1731 100** I can add this Pokémon for 100 pc\
\
\
**Market Removing -** \
If you want to remove a Pokémon you own on The Market because you want it back, you can use **p!m r \<listing ID>**. After that, a confirmation message will pop up and ask you if you want to remove your Pokémon. You can click **Confirm** and your Pokémon will come back to you, or you can click **Cancel** and your Pokémon will stay up on The Market. If you want to find a **** Pokémon you own on The Market, you can use **p!m s --mine** to filter the results down to only Pokémon you own on The Market. For Example:![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (32).png>)\
If this is a Pokémon you own on the market, you can use **p!m r 16214200**, and after clicking the confirmation message, your **** Pokémon will come back to you.\
