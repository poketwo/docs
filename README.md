Welcome to Pokétwo!

Pokétwo is a fan-created Discord bot based on the Pokémon Franchise that enables players to catch, trade, and battle Pokémon in their Discord servers (among other things). Originally created in 2020 as a replacement for the defunct Pokécord bot, Pokétwo has since grown to be the largest Pokémon bot on Discord, with over 3 million registered players in over 800,000 servers.

Whether you want to have fun with friends and see who can catch Pokémon the quickest, collect your favorite creatures from the Pokémon series, strategize to win battles with other trainers, or simply meet new people in our thriving community, Pokétwo has something for you.

If you just want to get your hands dirty as quickly as possible, check out our [Quickstart](quickstart.md). Or, read the details of the bot's various features and mechanics in the other pages of this wiki.
